# Dell ECS & Isilon Storage - Learning Project

This project showcases a basic learning experience in enterprise storage capacity planning and monitoring using **Dell ECS** and **Dell Isilon** systems. It is designed to demonstrate foundational understanding and hands-on practice with data organization, monitoring, and simulated planning tasks.

## üîß Technologies Explored
- **Dell ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage)**: Object storage platform
- **Dell Isilon**: Scale-out NAS storage system

## üìä What This Project Includes
- Simulated capacity planning sheet for ECS storage
- Sample dashboard (mock-up) for Isilon storage health
- Summary report of usage trends and storage health metrics

## üìÅ Files
- `ecs_capacity_planning.xlsx`: Sample spreadsheet modeling object count, capacity used, and growth trends
- `isilon_storage_dashboard.png`: Mock-up image of a dashboard showing Isilon usage and node status
- `storage_summary_report.pdf`: A report summarizing ECS and Isilon monitoring metrics and simulated alerts

## üß† What I Learned
- Understanding of object vs file storage
- ECS bucket policies and capacity estimates
- Isilon cluster overview and node health
- Capacity planning basics
- Dashboard design considerations for storage monitoring

This is a self-driven educational project. I am continuing to learn more about Dell ECS and Dell Isilon from Dell documentation, YouTube resources, and technical blogs.
